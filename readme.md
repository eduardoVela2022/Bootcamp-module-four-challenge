# Bootcamp-module-four-challenge

## Description

I created this project to practice my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. This project was fun, since I was able to see how each technology contributed to the website. HTML provided the structure of the website, CSS its styling and responsive design, and Javascript the interactivity to make the site function and make it store data in the local storage of the user. This was a great learning experience, since I got to practice all the knowledge that I have learned during the bootcamp so far, while also learning brand-new things like implementing a fully functional dark mode.
